This is a training project, not intended to be a full application. Some functionalities will be duplicated to provide a comparison between multiple programming techniques and API calls to different services.

Login behaviour:

The Auth model uses for default email as a login identifier. Most of the users have few emails accounts, this situation increase the risk to allow access to the wrong user.
The hacker work is reduced by 50%, once (s)he has the first part of the access granted, "The email account". 
Having multiple "Usernames" for different applications WAS SAFER, but were more work for the "Marketing" guys. (THANK YOU! )
